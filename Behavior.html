<button  class="button section3" style="margin-top: 15px; border-top: 7px solid #333333;"><span> Peeing on personal belongings</span> </button>
             <div class="panel" style="background-color: #d9c9e9">


<p>Cats like their environment to have their scent, so when foreign-smelling objects invade their space, they will often choose to mingle their familiar scent with the new one. One of the most effective ways of transferring scent is to urinate or spray on objects.</p>
<p>While it may seem disgusting to you that your cat has urinated in your suitcase or embarrassing that they have sprayed over your friend's handbag, this behaviour may actually be relieving some of the anxiety your feline friend is feeling.You can prevent this happening by being very tidy with your belongings and by relieving your cat's anxiety.</p>

 <button  class="button section3" ><span> Rubbing</span></button>
             <div class="panel" >
             <p>Cats love to rub up against their owners. This movement may involve their entire body or sometimes just their foreheads and cheeks. Most owners see this as a sign of affection and welcome this behaviour.</p>
<p>When cats rub against objects, they are transferring their scent. It is almost as if they are claiming ownership and we are one of their belongings. Your cat head-butting or nuzzling your face deposits scent from glands in their cheek area. Their weaving through your legs, usually as you prepare to feed them, transfers scent from their sides and tails on to you. This behaviour is also an effective way of making sure that they have your full attention.</p>

            </div>
            <button  class="button section3" style=""><span> Scratching</span></button>
             <div class="panel" >
             <p>Cats need to scratch surfaces to sharpen their claws but they also use this behaviour to deposit their scent. Cats have scent glands on their paws and rubbing their paws along objects places their scent there.</p>
             <p>If your cat has the annoying habit of scratching furniture, it is often because this is an area that attracts many different scents. The sides of sofas, for example, are favoured areas and these may have the scents of outdoors, our guests, our bags or shoes. In performing the scratching behaviour, your cat replaces the foreign scent with their own.</p>
             <p>If scratching is a problem, then scratching posts are a must. Place these in areas that cats like to scratch and then gradually move them towards your preferred location. There is no use hiding scratching posts in corners, as cats need to scratch in prominent areas. They also often like to scratch at different angles so provide horizontal and vertical scratching surfaces.</p>

            <button  class="button section3" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span>Meowing</span></button>
             <div class="panel">
             <p>Cats meow to communicate with humans. This endearing method of speech is heard in young kittens, to get their mother's attention but is rarely heard between cats. So when your cat meows to you, it is a special form of cat-to-human conversation.</p>
            <p>You can encourage your cat's meow by responding to it. Alternatively, if your cat talks too much, you should ignore the meows and respond when they are quiet.</p>
            </div>
            <button  class="button section3" ><span>Kneeding </span></button>
             <div class="panel" >
             <p>Cats kneed prior to relaxing. This involves pacing with their paws, on top of a soft object - usually a bed, a blanket or our lap. Some cats will purr or even drool at the same time. Kneeding is often a pleasant behaviour - until the claws come out.</p>
             <p>Kneeding first begins when kittens are suckling milk from their mother, the padding behaviour stimulating milk release. Cats carry on with this behaviour, perhaps to recreate pleasant feelings, to create a comfortable spot or to place their scent on the underlying object.</p>
             <p>If you enjoy your cat on your lap but can't stand the claws, keep their claws trimmed and place a thick blanket between you and your cat.</p>
