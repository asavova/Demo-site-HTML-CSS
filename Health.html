               <div class="panel" style="background-color: #d9c9e9">
               <p>Research estimates that 63 to 67 days, or nine-weeks, is how long most cats are pregnant. As a foster parent for an animal shelter or rescue group, felines in your care may often have shorter cat pregnancy lengths due to unknown conception dates.</p>
               <h2>Which signs will tell if a cat is pregnant?</h2>
               <p>If you find yourself fostering a cat, there are three types of signs that can help answer how to tell if a cat is pregnant. Not all cats show all these signs and the best way to confirm if you’re caring for a pregnant cat is to have her examined by the assigned foster care veterinarian team.</p>

   <button  class="button section3" ><span> Feline Immunodeficiency Virus</span></button>
               <div class="panel" >
               <p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is responsible for a fatal disease syndrome in cats that is similar to HIV infections in humans. For that reason it is often referred to as kitty AIDS, but it must be borne in mind that it is not contagious to humans or other animals. FIV infected cats are found worldwide, with estimates in healthy cats ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent in the United States. Like AIDS, cats can be FIV positive for years before showing any signs of clinical illness. Fortunately, it is not as easily spread as feline leukemia virus, nor is it as common. Although no cure exists, it does not present an automatic reason to euthanize cats in shelters. Appropriate adoptive homes may be found, and they can be held safely in the shelter until rehomed if certain precautions can be taken.</p>
               <h2>Symptoms</h2>
               <p>The white blood cell count drops 4-6 weeks after infection, which is when signs will begin to appear. This is the initial acute phase, wherein signs may start out very vaguely, with anemia, a poor hair coat, appetite loss, swollen lymph nodes and fever. They often recover from this phase. The second phase may last for years, during which time the cat often appears to be normal. It must be borne in mind that although they may have periods of normal health alternating with illness, infection is lifelong. Dental problems, inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and mouth (stomatitis) are very common, along with other infections of the urinary bladder, skin and upper respiratory tract appearing. </p>
               <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
               <p>There is a new FIV vaccine available. Unfortunately it interferes with disease testing and is not recommended for use in shelters. If used however, cats should be tested beforehand, and positive cats should not be vaccinated with it.</p>

              </div>
                <button  class="button section3" ><span> Feline Leukemia Virus</span></button>
                             <div class="panel" >
                             <p>Feline leukemia is caused by a retrovirus that only infects members of the feline family. It is not believed to be contagious to humans. It is readily destroyed in the environment, being susceptible to inactivation with heat, soap, most disinfectants and drying. Even in the proper environment, it will only last outside the cat’s body for 24-48 hours. For these reasons, cats may be safely held in shelters with minimal risk of disease spread, but only if they are housed in individual cages, and rules about proper sanitation and washing hands between handling cats are strictly enforced. In addition, long waiting periods do not have to be observed before adopting a new cat into a household that previously housed a leukemia positive cat.</p>
                            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                            <p>The symptoms of feline leukemia infection can be very vague and non-specific, including vomiting, loss of appetite and weight, lethargy, anemia, etc. As the infection progresses, symptoms may be seen that correlate with the organ system that is affected by the virus. For example, if the intestines are affected, diarrhea may be seen. The most common cancers include leukemia and lymphoma. Abortions and stillbirths may occur. These cats are also susceptible to infections by other organisms because of the immunosuppressive nature of the infection, and commonly succumb to other diseases. If routine FeLV screening is not performed, it is always indicated in cats with diseases that are non- responsive to therapy or in cats with recurrent fevers and other signs of clinical disease.</p>
                             <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
                             <p>A FeLV vaccine is available. Cats should be tested before the vaccine is given. Avoid vaccinating FeLV positive cats. The vaccine is generally believed to be effective, but it is not recommended for routine use in the shelter. The vaccine has been implicated in the development of vaccine- associated sarcomas (tumors) and should be given SQ over the lateral aspect of the left thigh in case a sarcoma develops that necessitates limb amputation.</p>

              <button  class="button section3" style=""><span> Best vaccines for a kitten</span></button>
               <div class="panel" >
<p> The age of your pet, his needs and the area where you live can greatly influence the types of vaccinations your cat receives and how often.</p>
<p>Vaccinations are typically started at 6 weeks of age, and the length of completion can vary based on the size of your pet and what vaccinations he is receiving.</p>
<p>Vaccines are boosted every two to four weeks until the pet is protected and then boosted every year. Take your pet in for a veterinary exam and your vet can start your new kitten on a good schedule.</p>
