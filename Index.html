           <p>     As cats get older their sense of smell and taste may be reduced. Tempt her to eat by feeding richer foods.
  Older cats digest their food less well and may need to eat relatively more food to absorb all the nutrients they need.

<h3>What does it mean to be responsible? </h3>
<hr class="pink">
<div class="multicolumn">
<p >The dictionary defines it as “the duty of taking care of something”, which summarises what it means to be a cat guardian.
<p> This duty of care is enshrined in law, which states it is an offence not to provide adequate food, shelter, and freedom from pain.  </p><p>  However, the law is aimed at preventing cruelty, rather than promoting responsible cat ownership.</p><p>Simply letting a cat be a cat is deceptively hard work. You need to understand how the feline mind works and adjust your life to fit.Cats like to keep themselves to themselves, and they come to us on their terms.</p><p >To me, being a responsible pet owner means taking care of both the emotional and physical needs of my cats –this is what separates merely owning a cat from being a great cat owner.

<p>Many cat food commercials focus on the ingredients (raw materials). This may be a matter of taste for the cat, but whether the food is made from pork, chicken or shrimp is not really important for health and nutrition.</p>

   <p>What IS important, however, is that the food contains a sufficient amount of the nutrients that cats need. This is because cats are “obligate carnivores” and must have a certain amount of meat protein and other meat nutrients in their food. This meat must be digestible quality meat/protein so that the cat can use it efficiently, e.g. from muscles and liver and not just from skin, chicken feet and feathers. The balance between proteins, carbohydrates (vegetables) and fat in the food is also important, but this can be achieved with many different ingredients.



    </p>
   <h2>Kittens</h2>
    <p style="color: #333333">These babies need more fats and proteins than grown cats, so look for foods with "Complete and Balanced Nutrition" on the label as well as the AAFCO animal feeding tested statement "for all life stages". There are also foods specifically formulated for kittens. </p>

<h2>Adult Cats</h2>
    <p style="color: #333333">Canned foods are better for cats, but your cat may be used to dry food only. Grown cats thrive on dry food, and any of the premium brands are acceptable. You should also supplement with canned food, because eventually you should try to move your cat over to canned only.Recommended Reading: </p>

 <button  class="button section3" ><span> What are the best hypoallergenic cat breeds?</span></button>
             <div class="panel" >
             <p>Allergies taking a toll on you? Constant sneezing and itching can deter from affection you’d like to give cats. You’re not alone. In fact, people are twice as likely to have cat allergies than dog allergies. Still, furry felines are hard to resist.</p>
             <p>If you’re still longing to have a cat, there are some “hypoallergenic” breeds known to produce fewer allergens than other cats. Keep in mind, no breed is completely non-allergenic but a different choice in breed may cut down on adverse reactions.</p>
<h2>What causes allergies to cats?</h2>
             <p>Ever wondered what causes the allergies you suffer from? It’s not the cat’s fur, it’s actually a protein called Fel D1 found in cat saliva that causes you to sneeze and feel itchy. Once a cat licks their coat, the allergen-laden saliva dries and becomes airborne, increasing likelihood for a response.</p>
             <p>Some breeds produce less of this protein than others, making them ideal cats for people with allergies. In addition to the Fel D1 protein, there are other factors that influence a cat’s allergen production:</p>
             <h2>Factors that affect allergen production in cats</h2>
             <ul class="panellist">

             <a><li>Males produce more allergenic secretions than females</li></a>
             <a><li>Intact males produce more than neutered males</li></a>
             <a><li>Dark cats tend to produce more than light-colored ones</li></a>
             <a><li>Kittens produce fewer allergens than adults</li></a>

           <p style="color: #333333">You can play an important role in the healthcare of your pet by being on the look out for changes in behaviour and appearance. Make sure you groom weekly and check for sores, lumps and smells. If you notice any changes, please contact cat friendly healthcare team for further advice.  Early detection can play a critical role in the continued health and wellbeing of a senior pet.</p>

            <button  class="button section3" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span>How to find a lost cat?</span></button>
             <div class="panel">
            <ul class="panellist">
              <li>Take a large cardboard box and flip it over. Cut a cat sized hole in the side and place it outdoors with some soft bedding inside. Weight the bottom down and make this a safe place your cat can return to. Place food and water and cat litter box nearby.</li>
              <li>The best time to search for a lost cat is when the world is asleep. The best time-frame is around 2:00 a.m. Go out with a flashlight and food. You can take a few cans of cat food with you, stand out in the open and pop the cans, or shake a treat jar. You will be surprised how the sound can travel in the quiet of the morning, and oftentimes your cat will appear within minutes of the first can being opened. Enterprising cat owners have also recorded the sound of their can openers opening a tin of food, and played the tape over and over while looking for their lost cat.                    </li>
              <li>Make up fliers. Include a picture of your cat and offer a reward as incentive. Post these fliers in grocery stores, at vet offices, feed stores, anywhere you can. Post them at eye level. DO NOT stuff them in mailboxes. You can get into trouble for doing this. Walk your neighborhood with these fliers, put them on telephone poles, and talk to the kids of the neighborhood, the paper boy the UPS driver, the mailman anyone who walks your neighborhood.                  </li>
              <li>Call the local papers and place a lost cat ad. Call the local radio stations, many of them will run free air spots for lost critters. Call your vet and let the staff know your cat is missing. Tack up a flier at all the vets in your area, and take one over to any rescue shelters nearby. If you have recently moved and brought the cat with you, check out your old address as well.</li>

            <button  class="button section3" ><span>Why won't my adult cat play? </span></button>
             <div class="panel" >
             <p>Does your cat just sit there, looking at you, when you toss it a ball or dangle a string? You may be concerned that your cat needs the stimulation and activity of play. Learn why your cat seems indifferent to play and what you can do about it.</p>
             <p>Cats fall into a range of personalities and activity levels. All kittens play but their interest in high-energy games peaks at around ages 4 to 5 months, and decline thereafter. Once cats reach adulthood, they tend to fall into two major groups. There are the ankle-rubbers who continue to play and the lap-sitters who prefer less activity. There can be ways to encourage activity, which is healthy for both the body and brain.</p>
             <h2>Health</h2>
             <p>Health certainly influences activity levels. Age-related issues such as arthritis can reduce interest in play. But any sort of health challenge that makes the cat feel poorly—intestinal worms, for example—might reduce the cat’s activity.</p>
             <h2>Instinct</h2>
             <p>Cat play mimics hunting. Movement triggers the paw-patting and chasing behavior. Kittens indulge in self-play and can entertain themselves. They have great fun tossing toys and chasing human feet, but adult cats need more direct stimulation. Cat toys typically are only as good as the human on the other end of the toy.</p>
             <h2>Stress</h2>
             <p>Any kind of stress, often brought about by a sudden change, can impact a cat’s activity level. Cats that feel overwhelmed by stress won’t want to play.</p>
             <h2>Symptoms, Signs, and Solutions</h2>
             <p>Changes in your cat's usual behavior can be a sign of a health condition. If your cat usually likes to play but suddenly is inactive or lethargic, it is worth talking to your veterinarian. A check-up might reveal a urinary tract infection or another issue that can be cleared up with treatment. If your cat is in good health, then you can look for ways to stimulate play more effectively.
